# Grayscale Equalizer Project

This project consists of the implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) that emulates a grayscale equalizer for images. The repo contains the VHDL code (10610720_10665739.vhd) implementing the FSM behaviour, a picture of the states and their conditioned transitions, and a document with the high-level detailed explanation (10610720_10665739.pdf) of the project. This FSM was simulated in Vivado environment.
The numbers naming the files were the university Person codes associated to the two authors of this project, myself and Mr. Claudio Galimberti. The high-level description is in Italian: if interested, feel free to contact me for its summary in English, German or French.
