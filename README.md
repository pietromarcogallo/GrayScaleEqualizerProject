# Grayscale Equalizer Project

This project consists of the implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) that emulates a grayscale equalizer for images. The repo contains the VHDL code implementing the FSM behaviour, a picture of the states and their conditioned transitions, and a document with the high-level detailed explanation of the project. This FSM was simulated in Vivado environment.
